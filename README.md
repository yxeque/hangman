1. Setting Up the Project:

Create a new Ruby file: Name it hangman.rb or something similar.
Install the json gem: This gem is used for saving and loading game data. You can install it by running gem install json in your terminal.
Define the Hangman class: This will hold all the game logic and state. 2. Initializing the Game:

Inside the Hangman class, define an initialize method. This method takes no arguments for now.
Create variables to store:
@secret_word: The randomly chosen word from the dictionary.
@guessed_letters: An array to keep track of guessed letters.
@remaining_guesses: The number of guesses remaining.
@dictionary: The loaded dictionary of words (defined separately later).
Call the load_dictionary method to read the dictionary and filter it for words between 5 and 12 characters.
Randomly choose a word from the filtered dictionary and assign it to @secret_word.
Initialize @guessed_letters as an empty array.
Set @remaining_guesses to a desired value (e.g., 6). 3. Displaying the Word:

Define a method called display*word.
This method takes no arguments.
It iterates through the @secret_word characters:
If the character is in @guessed_letters, display it directly.
Otherwise, display an underscore (*).
Concatenate these characters and return the final displayed word. 4. Player Input and Guessing:

Define a method called get_guess.
This method prompts the player with "Enter a letter (or 'save' to save game):".
It reads the input using gets.chomp.
Convert the input to uppercase for case-insensitive comparisons.
Add checks to handle different scenarios:
If the input is "SAVE", return "save" indicating save request.
If the input is a single letter not already in @guessed_letters, return the letter.
Otherwise, display an error message and call the method again. 5. Checking the Guess:

Define a method called check_guess.
This method takes a letter as an argument.
Check if the letter is present in @secret_word:
If present, update @guessed_letters and add the letter's positions to the displayed word (using display_word).
If not present, decrement @remaining_guesses.
Return a boolean indicating whether the guess was correct (true) or not (false). 6. Game Loop:

Define a while loop that continues until the game is won or lost.
Inside the loop:
Call display_word to show the current state of the word.
Call get_guess to get the player's guess or save request.
If the guess is "save", call save_game to save the game state.
Otherwise, call check_guess to process the guess.
Check if the player has won (all letters guessed) or lost (no guesses remaining).
Display appropriate messages for winning or losing. 7. Saving and Loading:

Define a method called save_game.
This method converts the current game state (using to_json) and writes it to a file named "saved_game.json".
Define a class method called load_game.
This method reads the game state from the file, parses it using JSON.parse, and creates a new Hangman object with the loaded data. 8. Testing and Enhancement:

Test the game thoroughly with different scenarios.
Implement visual hangman representation, difficulty levels, word categories, and error handling as desired.
